Steeltoe Connectors simplify the process of connecting and using services on Cloud Foundry. Steeltoe Connectors provide a simple abstraction for .NET based applications running on Cloud Foundry, letting them discover bound services and deployment information at runtime. The connectors also provide support for registering the services as injectable service objects.

The Steeltoe Connectors provide out-of-the-box support for discovering many common services on Cloud Foundry. They also include the ability to use settings-based configuration so that developers can supply configuration settings at development and testing time but then have those settings be overridden when pushing the application to Cloud Foundry.

All connectors use configuration information from Cloud Foundry's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable to detect and configure the available services. This a Cloud Foundry standard that is used to hold connection and identification information for all service instances that have been bound to Cloud Foundry applications.

For more information on `VCAP_SERVICES`, see the Cloud Foundry [documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/).

>NOTE: Depending on your hosting environment, service instances you create for the purpose of exploring the Quick Starts on this page may have a cost associated.

# 0.0 Initialize Dev Environment

All of the Steeltoe sample applications are in the same repository. If you have not already done so, use git to clone the [Steeltoe samples](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples) repository or download it with your browser from GitHub. You can run the following git command to clone the repository from the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples.git
```

>NOTE: All connector samples in that repository have a base path of `Samples/Connectors/src/`

Make sure your Cloud Foundry CLI tools are logged in and targeting the correct org and space, as follows:

```bash
cf login [-a API_URL] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-o ORG] [-s SPACE] [--skip-ssl-validation]
```

or

```bash
cf target -o <YourOrg> -s <YourSpace>
```

# 1.0 MySQL

This connector simplifies using MySQL ADO.NET providers in an application running on Cloud Foundry.

Currently, the connector supports the following providers:

* [Connector/NET](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/)
* [MySqlConnector](https://mysql-net.github.io/MySqlConnector/)

In addition to the [Quick Start](#1-1-quick-start), you can refer to several other Steeltoe sample applications to help you understand how to use this connector:

* [AspDotNet4/MySql4](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/MySql4): Same as the next Quick Start but built for ASP.NET 4.x.
* [MusicStore](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/MusicStore): A sample app showing how to use all of the Steeltoe components together in a ASP.NET Core application. This is a micro-services based application built from the ASP.NET Core MusicStore reference app provided by Microsoft.
* [FreddysBBQ](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/FreddysBBQ): A polyglot (Java and .NET) micro-services based sample application showing interoperability between Java and .NET based micro-services running on Cloud Foundry, secured with OAuth2 Security Services, and using Spring Cloud Services.

This connector provides a `IHealthContributor` which you can use in conjunction with the [Steeltoe Management Health](https://steeltoe.io/docs/steeltoe-management/#1-2-3-health) check endpoint.  See the [Using Health Contributors](#using-health-contributors) section for details on how to make use of it.

The source code for this connector can be found [here](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors).

## 1.1 Quick Start

This quick start consists of using several ASP.NET Core sample applications that show how to use the Steeltoe MySQL Connector for connecting to a MySQL service on Cloud Foundry.

There are three sample applications you can choose from for this quick start:

* AspDotNetCore/MySql: Uses a `MySqlConnection` to issue commands to the bound database.
* AspDotNetCore/MySqlEF6: Uses an Entity Framework 6 `DbContext` to access the bound database.
* AspDotNetCore/MySqlEFCore: Uses a Entity Framework Core `DbContext` to access the bound database.

### 1.1.1 Locate Sample

Depending on your specific interests, pick one of the following samples to work with going forward:

* MySqlConnection sample: Change directory to `Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/MySql`.
* Entity Framework 6 `DbContext` sample: Change directory to `Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/MySqlEF6`.
* Entity Framework Core `DbContext` sample: Change directory to `Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/MySqlEFCore`.

### 1.1.2 Create Service

In this step, we use the Cloud Foundry CLI to create a service instance of MySQL on Cloud Foundry.

The commands in this section assume you are using the MySQL service provided by Pivotal on Cloud Foundry. If you are using a different service, adjust the `create-service` command below to fit your environment.

```bash
# Create a MySQL service instance on Cloud Foundry
cf create-service p-mysql 100mb myMySqlService

# Make sure the service is ready
cf services
```

### 1.1.3 Publish and Push the Sample

See [Publish Sample](#publish-sample) and the sections that follow for instructions on how to publish and push this sample to either Linux or Windows.

### 1.1.4 Observe Logs

Optionally, you can use the `cf logs` command to see log output.

### 1.1.5 View Data

At this point, the application is up and running. On startup, it inserts a couple of rows into the bound MySQL database.

To display those rows, click the "MySql Data" link in the top menu and you should see the row data displayed.

### 1.1.6 Understand the Sample

Each of the samples were created by using the .NET Core tooling `mvc` template (`dotnet new mvc`) and then modified to add the Steeltoe framework.

To understand the Steeltoe related changes to the generated template code, examine the following files:

* `*.csproj` files: Contain the `PackageReference` for the Steeltoe NuGet Connector and the Configuration packages. Also, a `PackageReference` for Oracle's MySQL provider, `MySql.Data`, has been added. If Entity Framework has been used, you see references to those packages as well.
* `Program.cs`: Added `.UseCloudFoundryHosting()` for dynamic port binding and `.AddCloudFoundry()` to read `VCAP_SERVICES` when pushed to Cloud Foundry.
* `Startup.cs`: Code added to the `ConfigureServices()` method to add a `MySqlConnection` or a `DbContext`, depending on the application, to the service container.
* `HomeController.cs`: Code added for injection of a `MySqlConnection` or `DbContext` into the Controller. These are used to obtain data from the database and then to display the data.
* `MySqlData.cshtml`: The view used to display the MySQL data values.
* `Models folder`: Contains code to initialize the database and the definition of `DbContext` classes for the MySqlEF6 and MySqlEFCore samples.

## 1.2 Usage

You should know how the new .NET [Configuration service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration) works before starting to use the connector. A basic understanding of the `ConfigurationBuilder` and how to add providers to the builder is necessary in order to configure the connector.

You should also know how the ASP.NET Core [Startup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/startup) class is used in configuring the application services for the app. Pay particular attention to the usage of the `ConfigureServices()` method.

To use this connector:

1. Create a MySQL Service instance and bind it to your application.
1. Optionally, configure any MySQL client settings (such as `appsettings.json`) you need.
1. Add the Steeltoe Cloud Foundry configuration provider to your `ConfigurationBuilder`.
1. Add `MySqlConnection` or `DbContext` to your `IServiceCollection`.

### 1.2.1 Add NuGet Reference

To use the MySQL connector, add your choice of MySQL-specific package(s) between [MySql.Data](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data)/[MySql.Data.Entity](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data.Entity), [MySqlConnector](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySqlConnector/), and [Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql/) as you would if you weren't using Steeltoe. Then, add a reference to the appropriate [Steeltoe Connector NuGet package](#add-nuget-references).

### 1.2.2 Configure Settings

The connector supports a variety of configuration options. You can use these settings to develop or test an application locally and override them during deployment.

The following MySQL connector configuration shows how to connect to a database at `myserver:3306`:

```json
{
  ...
  "mysql": {
    "client": {
      "server": "myserver",
      "port": 3306
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

The following table describes the available settings for the connector. These settings are not specific to Steeltoe. They are passed through to the underlying data provider. See the [Oracle MySQL Connection String docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-connection-options.html) or [open source MySQL Connection String docs](https://mysql-net.github.io/MySqlConnector/connection-options/).

|Key|Description|Steeltoe Default|
|---|---|:---:|
|server|Hostname or IP Address of the server|localhost|
|port|Port number of server|3306|
|username|Username for authentication|not set|
|password|Password for authentication|not set|
|database|Schema to which to connect|not set|
|connectionString|Full connection string|built from settings|
|sslMode|SSL usage option. One of `None`, `Preferred`, or `Required`|`None`|
|allowPublicKeyRetrieval|Whether RSA public keys should be retrieved from the server|not set|
|allowUserVariables|Whether the provider expects user variables in the SQL|not set|
|connectionTimeout|Seconds to wait for a connection before throwing an error|not set|
|connectionLifeTime|The maximum length of time a connection to the server can be open|not set|
|connectionReset|Whether the connection state is reset when it is retrieved from the pool|not set|
|convertZeroDateTime|Whether to have MySqlDataReader.GetValue() and MySqlDataReader.GetDateTime() return DateTime.MinValue for date or datetime columns that have disallowed values|not set|
|defaultCommandTimeout|Seconds each command can execute before timing out. Use 0 to disable timeouts|not set|
|keepalive|TCP keep-alive idle time|not set|
|maximumPoolsize|Maximum number of connections allowed in the pool|not set|
|minimumPoolsize|Minimum number of connections to leave in the pool if ConnectionIdleTimeout is reached|not set|
|oldGuids|Whether to use a GUID of data type BINARY(16)|not set|
|persistSecurityInfo|Whether to allow the application to access to security-sensitive information, such as the password. **_(Not recommended)_**|not set|
|pooling|Enables connection pooling|not set|
|treatTinyAsBoolean|Whether to return tinyint(1) as a boolean. Set to `false` to return tinyint(1) as sbyte/byte|not set|
|useAffectedRows|Set to `false` to report found rows instead of changed (affected) rows|not set|
|useCompression|If `true` (and server-supported), packets sent between client and server are compressed|not set|
|urlEncodedCredentials|Set to `true` if your service broker provides URL-encoded credentials|false|

>IMPORTANT: All of the settings described in the preceding table should be prefixed with `mysql:client:`.

The samples and most templates are already set up to read from `appsettings.json`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

>NOTE: If a ConnectionString is provided and VCAP_SERVICES are not detected (a typical scenario for local app development), the ConnectionString will be used exactly as provided.

### 1.2.3 Cloud Foundry

To use MySQL on Cloud Foundry, you can create and bind an instance of MySQL to your application by using the Cloud Foundry CLI, as follows:

```bash
# Create MySQL service
cf create-service p-mysql 100mb myMySqlService

# Bind service to `myApp`
cf bind-service myApp myMySqlService

# Restage the app to pick up change
cf restage myApp
```

>NOTE: The preceding commands assume you use [MySQL for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql), provided by Pivotal on Cloud Foundry. If you use a different service, you must adjust the `create-service` command to fit your environment.

Version 2.1.1+ of this connector works with the [Azure Open Service Broker for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/azure-open-service-broker-pcf/index.html). Be sure to set `mysql:client:urlEncodedCredentials` to `true` as this broker may provide credentials that have been URL Encoded.

Once the service is bound to your application, the connector's settings are available in `VCAP_SERVICES`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

### 1.2.4 Add MySqlConnection

To use a `MySqlConnection` in your application, add it to the service container in the `ConfigureServices()` method of the `Startup` class, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.MySql;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add MySqlConnection configured from Configuration
        services.AddMySqlConnection(Configuration);

        // Add framework services.
        services.AddMvc();
        ...
    }
    ...
```

The `AddMySqlConnection(Configuration)` method call configures the `MySqlConnection` by using the configuration built by the application and adds the connection to the service container.

### 1.2.5 Use MySqlConnection

Once you have configured and added the connection to the service container, it is trivial to inject and use in a controller or a view, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using MySql.Data.MySqlClient;
...
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult MySqlData([FromServices] MySqlConnection dbConnection)
    {
        dbConnection.Open();

        MySqlCommand cmd = new MySqlCommand("SELECT * FROM TestData;", dbConnection);
        MySqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();

        while (rdr.Read())
        {
            ViewData["Key" + rdr[0]] = rdr[1];
        }

        rdr.Close();
        dbConnection.Close();

        return View();
    }
}
```

### 1.2.6 Add DbContext

#### 1.2.6.1 Entity Framework 6

To use the MySQL connector with Entity Framework 6, inject a `DbContext` into your application using the `AddDbContext<>()` method (provided by Steeltoe) that takes an `IConfiguration` as a parameter, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.MySql.EF6;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...
        services.AddDbContext<TestContext>(Configuration);
        ...
    }
    ...
```

The `AddDbContext<TestContext>(..)` method call configures `TestContext` using the configuration built earlier and then adds the DbContext (called `TestContext`) to the service container.

Your `DbContext` does not need to be modified from a standard EF6 `DbContext` to work with Steeltoe:

```csharp
using MySql.Data.Entity;
using System.Data.Entity;
...

[DbConfigurationType(typeof(MySqlEFConfiguration))]
public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public TestContext(string connectionString) : base(connectionString)
    {
    }
    public DbSet<TestData> TestData { get; set; }
}
```

#### 1.2.6.2 Entity Framework Core

To use the MySQL connector with Entity Framework Core, inject a `DbContext` into your application with the standard `AddDbContext<>()` method, substituting Steeltoe's `UseMySql` method that takes an `IConfiguration` as a parameter in the options configuration for the standard `UseMySql` method. This example demonstrates the basic usage:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.MySql.EFCore;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...
        services.AddDbContext<TestContext>(options => options.UseMySql(Configuration));
        ...
    }
    ...
```

Your `DbContext` does not need to be modified from a standard `DbContext` to work with Steeltoe:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
...

public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public TestContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
    {

    }
    public DbSet<TestData> TestData { get; set; }
}

```

If you need to set additional properties for the `DbContext` like `MigrationsAssembly` or connection retry settings, create an `Action<MySqlDbContextOptionsBuilder>` like this:

```csharp
Action<MySqlDbContextOptionsBuilder> mySqlOptionsAction = (o) =>
{
  o.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(Startup).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetName().Name);
  // Configuring Connection Resiliency: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency
  o.EnableRetryOnFailure(maxRetryCount: 15, maxRetryDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30), errorNumbersToAdd: null);
};
```

Pass your new options action into the AddDbContext method:

```csharp
services.AddDbContext<TestContext>(options => options.UseMySql(Configuration, mySqlOptionsAction));
```

### 1.2.7 Use DbContext

Once you have configured and added the DbContext to the service container, inject and use it in a controller or a view, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Project.Models;
...
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult MySqlData([FromServices] TestContext context)
    {
        return View(context.TestData.ToList());
    }
```

# 2.0 PostgreSQL

This connector simplifies using PostgreSQL in an application running on Cloud Foundry.

Currently, the connector supports the [Npgsql](https://www.npgsql.org/) provider.

This connector provides a `IHealthContributor` which you can use in conjunction with the [Steeltoe Management Health](https://steeltoe.io/docs/steeltoe-management/#1-2-3-health) check endpoint.  See the [Using Health Contributors](#using-health-contributors) section for details on how to make use of it.

You can find the source code for this connector [here](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors).

## 2.1 Quick Start

This quick start consists of several ASP.NET Core sample applications that show how to use the Steeltoe PostgreSQL Connector to connect to a PostgreSQL service on Cloud Foundry.

You can choose from two sample applications:

* PostgreSql: Shows how to use a `NpgsqlConnection` to issue commands to the bound database.
* PostgreEFCore: Shows how to use an Entity Framework Core `DbContext` to access the bound database.

In addition to this quick start, there is an ASP.NET4 sample that was built with Autofac in [Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/PostgreSql4](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/PostgreSql4).

### 2.1.1 Locate Sample

Depending on your specific interests, pick one of the following samples to work with going forward:

```bash
# Use a `NpgsqlConnection`
cd Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/PostgreSql

# Use a Entity Framework Core `DbContext`
cd Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/PostgreEFCore
```

### 2.1.2 Create Service

Now you can use the Cloud Foundry CLI to create a service instance of PostgreSQL on Cloud Foundry.

The commands in this section assume you use the EDB PostgreSQL service on Cloud Foundry.

If you use a different service, adjust the `create-service` command to fit environment.

To create the service and ensure that it is ready, use the following commands:

```bash
# Create a PostgreSQL service instance on Cloud Foundry
cf create-service EDB-Shared-PostgreSQL "Basic PostgreSQL Plan" myPostgres

# Make sure the service is ready
cf services
```

### 2.1.3 Publish and Push Sample

See [Publish Sample](#publish-sample) for instructions on how to publish and push this sample to either Linux or Windows.

### 2.1.4 Observe Logs

Optionally, you can use the `cf logs` command to see log output.

### 2.1.4 What to expect

At this point, the app is up and running. On startup, it inserts a couple of rows into the bound PostgreSQL database.

To display those rows, click on the `Postgres Data` link in the top menu.

### 2.1.5 Understand Sample

Each of the samples were created from the .NET Core tooling `mvc` template (`dotnet new mvc`) and then modified to include the Steeltoe framework.

To gain an understanding of the Steeltoe related changes to the generated template code, examine the following files:

* `PostgreSql.csproj`: Contains a `PackageReference` for the Steeltoe NuGet `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorCore`.
* `PostgreEFCore.csproj`: Contains a `PackageReference` for Steeltoe NuGet `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.EFCore`.
* `Program.cs`: Added `.UseCloudFoundryHosting()` for dynamic port binding and `.AddCloudFoundry()` to read `VCAP_SERVICES` when pushed to Cloud Foundry.
* `Startup.cs`: Code added to the `ConfigureServices()` method to add a `NpgsqlConnection` or a `DbContext`, depending on the application, to the service container.
* `HomeController.cs`: Code added to inject a `NpgsqlConnection` or `DbContext`, depending on the application, into the Controller and obtain data from the database for the view.
* `PostgresData.cshtml`: The view used to display the PostgreSQL data values.
* `Models folder`: Contains code to initialize the database and the `DbContext` for the PostgreEFCore sample.

## 2.2 Usage

You should know how the new .NET [Configuration service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration) works before starting to use the connector. You need a basic understanding of the `ConfigurationBuilder` and how to add providers to the builder to configure the connector.

You should also know how the ASP.NET Core [Startup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/startup) class is used to configure the application services for the app. Pay particular attention to the `ConfigureServices()` method.

To use this connector:

1. Create a PostgreSQL Service instance and bind it to your application.
1. Optionally, configure any PostgreSQL client settings (such as `appsettings.json`).
1. Add the Steeltoe Cloud Foundry config provider to your `ConfigurationBuilder`.
1. Add `NpgsqlConnection` or `DbContext` to your `IServiceCollection`.

### 2.2.1 Add NuGet Reference

To use the PostgreSQL connector, add your choice of PostgreSQL package between [Npgsql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql/) and [Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/) as you would if you weren't using Steeltoe. Then, add a reference to the appropriate [Steeltoe Connector NuGet package](#add-nuget-references).

>NOTE: Steeltoe does not currently include direct support for PostgreSQL with Entity Framework 6

### 2.2.2 Configure Settings

The PostgreSQL connector supports several settings for creating the `NpgsqlConnection` to a database. This can be useful when you develop and test an application locally and need to configure the connector for non-default settings.

The following example shows a PostgreSQL connector configuration (in JSON) to set up a connection to a database at `myserver:5432`:

```json
{
  ...
  "postgres": {
    "client": {
      "host": "myserver",
      "port": 5432
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

The following table describes all of the possible settings for the connector:

|Key|Description|Default
|---|---|---|
|server|Hostname or IP Address of server|localhost|
|port|Port number of server|5432|
|username|Username for authentication|not set|
|password|Password for authentication|not set|
|database|Schema to which to connect|not set|
|connectionString|Full connection string|built from settings
|urlEncodedCredentials|Set to `true` if your service broker provides URL-encoded credentials|false|

>IMPORTANT: All of these settings should be prefixed with `postgres:client:`.

The samples and most templates are already set up to read from `appsettings.json`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

>NOTE: If a ConnectionString is provided and VCAP_SERVICES are not detected (a typical scenario for local app development), the ConnectionString will be used exactly as provided.

### 2.2.3 Cloud Foundry

To use PostgreSQL on Cloud Foundry, after a PostgreSQL service is installed, you can create and bind an instance of it to your application by using the Cloud Foundry CLI, as follows:

```bash
# Create PostgreSQL service
cf create-service EDB-Shared-PostgreSQL "Basic PostgreSQL Plan" myPostgres

# Bind service to `myApp`
cf bind-service myApp myPostgres

# Restage the app to pick up change
cf restage myApp
```

>NOTE: The preceding commands work for the PostgreSQL service provided by EDB on Cloud Foundry. For another service, adjust the `create-service` command to fit your environment.

Version 2.1.1+ of this connector works with the [Azure Open Service Broker for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/azure-open-service-broker-pcf/index.html). Be sure to set `postgres:client:urlEncodedCredentials` to `true` as this broker may provide credentials that have been URL Encoded.

Once the service is bound to your application, the connector's settings are available in `VCAP_SERVICES`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

### 2.2.4 Add NpgsqlConnection

To use a `NpgsqlConnection` in your application, add it to the service container in the `ConfigureServices()` method of the `Startup` class, as shown in the following example:

 ```csharp
 using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.PostgreSql;

 public class Startup {
     ...
     public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
     public Startup(...)
     {
       ...
     }
     public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
     {
         // Add NpgsqlConnection configured from Cloud Foundry
         services.AddPostgresConnection(Configuration);

         // Add framework services.
         services.AddMvc();
         ...
     }
     ...
 ```

The `AddPostgresConnection(Configuration)` method call configures the `NpgsqlConnection` by using the configuration built by the application and adds the connection to the service container.

### 2.2.5 Use NpgsqlConnection

Once the connection is configured and added to the service container, you can inject and use in a controller or a view, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Npgsql;
...
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult PostgresData([FromServices] NpgsqlConnection dbConnection)
    {
        dbConnection.Open();

        NpgsqlCommand cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("SELECT * FROM TestData;", dbConnection);
        var rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();

        while (rdr.Read())
        {
            ViewData["Key" + rdr[0]] = rdr[1];
        }

        rdr.Close();
        dbConnection.Close();

        return View();
    }
}

```

### 2.2.6 Add DbContext

To use Entity Framework, inject and use a `DbContext` in your application instead of a `NpgsqlConnection` through the `AddDbContext<>()` method, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.PostgreSql.EFCore;

public class Startup {
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add EFCore TestContext configured with a PostgreSQL configuration
        services.AddDbContext<TestContext>(options => options.UseNpgsql(Configuration));

        // Add framework services.
        services.AddMvc();
        ...
    }
```

The `AddDbContext<TestContext>(options => options.UseNpgsql(Configuration));` method call configures the `TestContext` by using the configuration built by the application and adds the context to the service container.

The following example shows how you would define the `DbContext`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
...

public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public TestContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
    {
    }
    public DbSet<TestData> TestData { get; set; }
}
```

If you need to set additional properties for the `DbContext` like `MigrationsAssembly` or connection retry settings, create an `Action<NpgsqlDbContextOptionsBuilder>` like this:

```csharp
Action<NpgsqlDbContextOptionsBuilder> npgsqlOptionsAction = (o) =>
{
  o.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(Startup).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetName().Name);
  // Configuring Connection Resiliency: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency
  o.EnableRetryOnFailure(maxRetryCount: 15, maxRetryDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30), errorNumbersToAdd: null);
};
```

Pass your new options action into the AddDbContext method:

```csharp
services.AddDbContext<TestContext>(options => options.UseNpgsql(Configuration, npgsqlOptionsAction));
```

### 2.2.7 Use DbContext

Once you have configured and added the context to the service container, you can inject and use it in a controller or a view, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Project.Models;
...
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult PostgresData([FromServices] TestContext context)
    {
        return View(context.TestData.ToList());
    }
}
```

# 3.0 Microsoft SQL Server

This connector simplifies using Microsoft SQL Server in an application running on Cloud Foundry. The connector is built to work with `System.Data.SqlClient` and provides additional extension methods for using Entity Framework.

This connector provides a `IHealthContributor` which you can use in conjunction with the [Steeltoe Management Health](https://steeltoe.io/docs/steeltoe-management/#1-2-3-health) check endpoint.  See the [Using Health Contributors](#using-health-contributors) section for details on how to make use of it.

The source code for this connector can be found [here](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors).

## 3.1 Quick Start

This quick start consists of several ASP.NET sample applications to show how to use the Steeltoe SQL Server Connector for connecting to a SQL server from an application running on Cloud Foundry.

There are two sample applications to choose from:

* AspDotNet4/MsSql4: Using MVC5 and Entity Framework to issue commands to the bound database.
* AspDotNetCore/SqlServerEFCore: Using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core to access the bound database.

### 3.1.1 Locate Sample

Depending on your specific interests, pick one of the following samples to work with going forward:

```bash
# Use a .NET4/EF6 sample
cd Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/MsSql4

# or

# Use an ASP.NET Core/EFCore sample
cd Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/SqlServerEFCore
```

### 3.1.2 Create Service

If the [Microsoft SQL Server broker](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/mssql-server-broker) is installed in your Cloud Foundry instance, you can use it to create a new service instance, as follows:

```bash
cf create-service SqlServer sharedVM mySqlServerService
```

An alternative to the broker is to use a user-provided service to explicitly provide connection information to the application, as follows:

```bash
cf cups mySqlServerService -p '{"pw": "|password|","uid": "|user id|","uri": "jdbc:sqlserver://|host|:|port|;databaseName=|database name|"}'
```

Version 2.1.1+ of this connector works with the [Azure Open Service Broker for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/azure-open-service-broker-pcf/index.html). Be sure to set `sqlServer:client:urlEncodedCredentials` to `true` as this broker may provide credentials that have been URL Encoded.

### 3.1.3 Publish and Push Sample

See [Publish Sample](#publish-sample) and the sections that follow for instructions on how to publish and push this sample to either Linux or Windows.

### 3.1.4 Observe Logs

You can use the `cf logs` command to see log output.

### 3.1.5 View Data

At this point, the application is up and running. On startup, it inserts two rows into the bound Microsoft SQL database.

Loading the home page of the application shows those rows.

### 3.1.6 Understand Samples

The [Steeltoe samples](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples) include two samples for Microsoft SQL Server:

* [An ASP.NET Core sample](#3-1-7-1-asp.net-core-sample)
* [An ASP.NET 4.x sample](#3-1-7-2-asp.net-4.x-sample)

#### 3.1.6.1 ASP.NET Core Sample

This sample was created from the .NET Core tooling mvc template (`dotnet new mvc`) and then modified to include the Steeltoe framework.

To understand the Steeltoe related changes to the generated template code, examine the following files:

* `*.csproj`: Contains the `PackageReference` for the Steeltoe NuGet Connector and the Entity Framework.
* `Program.cs`: Added `.UseCloudFoundryHosting()` for dynamic port binding and `.AddCloudFoundry()` to read `VCAP_SERVICES` when pushed to Cloud Foundry.
* `Startup.cs`: Code added to the `ConfigureServices()` method to add a `DbContext` to the service container.
* `HomeController.cs`: Code added for injection of a `TestContext` into the Controller to obtain data from the database and then to display the data.
* `Index.cshtml`: The view used to display the data values from SQL Server.
* `Models folder`: Contains code to initialize the database and also the definition of the `DbContext` class.

#### 3.1.6.2 ASP.NET 4.x Sample

This sample was created with the standard Visual Studio template (File -> New Project) and then modified to add the Steeltoe framework.

To understand the Steeltoe related changes to the generated template code, examine the following files:

* `packages.config`: Contains references to the Steeltoe Common, Connector, and Configuration packages along with Entity Framework and StructureMap.
* `DependencyResolution folder`: Contains several classes from the StructureMap package. `IoC.cs` orchestrates application configuration and sets up dependency injection.
* `Data folder`: Contains code to initialize the database and also the definition of the `DbContext` class.
* `HomeController.cs`: Code added for injection of `IBloggingContext` into the Controller to obtain data from the database and then to display the data.
* `Index.cshtml`: The view used to display the data values from SQL Server.

## 3.2 Usage

You should know how the new .NET [Configuration service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration) works before starting to use the connector. You need a basic understanding of the `ConfigurationBuilder` and how to add providers to the builder to configure the connector.

You should also know how the ASP.NET Core [Startup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/startup) class is used in configuring the application services. Pay particular attention to the usage of the `ConfigureServices()` method.

To use this connector:

1. Create a Microsoft SQL Service instance and bind it to your application.
1. Optionally, configure any Microsoft SQL Server client settings (such as `appsettings.json`) you need.
1. Add the Steeltoe Cloud Foundry configuration provider to your `ConfigurationBuilder`.
1. Add `SqlConnection` or `DbContext` to your `IServiceCollection`.

### 3.2.1 Add NuGet Reference

To use the Microsoft SQL Server connector, add your choice of Microsoft SQL Server package between [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/), [Entity Framework](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/) and [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer/), as you would if you weren't using Steeltoe. Then, add a reference to the appropriate [Steeltoe Connector NuGet package](#add-nuget-references).

### 3.2.2 Configure Settings

The Microsoft SQL Server connector supports several configuration options. These settings can be used to develop or test an application locally and then be overridden during deployment.

The following Microsoft SQL Server connector configuration shows how to connect to SQL Server 2016 Express LocalDB:

```json
{
  ...
  "sqlserver": {
    "credentials": {
        "connectionString": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;database=Steeltoe;Trusted_Connection=True;"
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

The following table shows the available settings for the connector:

|Key|Description|Steeltoe Default|
|---|---|---|
|server|Hostname or IP Address of server|localhost|
|port|Port number of server|1433|
|username|Username for authentication|not set|
|password|Password for authentication|not set|
|database|Schema to which to connect|not set|
|connectionString|Full connection string|built from settings|
|integratedSecurity|Enable Windows Authentication (For local use only)|not set|
|urlEncodedCredentials|Set to `true` if your service broker provides URL-encoded credentials|false|

>IMPORTANT: All of the settings shown in the preceding table should be prefixed with `sqlserver:credentials:`.

The samples and most templates are already set up to read from `appsettings.json`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

>NOTE: If a ConnectionString is provided and VCAP_SERVICES are not detected (a typical scenario for local app development), the ConnectionString will be used exactly as provided.

### 3.2.3 Cloud Foundry

To use Microsoft SQL Server on Cloud Foundry, you need a service instance bound to your application. If the [Microsoft SQL Server broker](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/mssql-server-broker) is installed in your Cloud Foundry instance, use it to create a new service instance, as follows:

```bash
cf create-service SqlServer sharedVM mySqlServerService
```

An alternative to the broker is to use a user-provided service to explicitly provide connection information to the application, as shown in the following example:

```bash
cf cups mySqlServerService -p '{"pw": "|password|","uid": "|user id|","uri": "jdbc:sqlserver://|host|:|port|;databaseName=|database name|"}'
```

Version 2.1.1+ of this connector works with the [Azure Open Service Broker for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/azure-open-service-broker-pcf/index.html). Be sure to set `sqlServer:client:urlEncodedCredentials` to `true` as this broker may provide credentials that have been URL Encoded.

If you are creating a service for an application that has already been deployed, you need to bind the service and restart or restage the application with the following commands:

```bash
# Bind service to `myApp`
cf bind-service myApp mySqlServerService

# Restage the app to pick up change
cf restage myApp
```

If you have not already deployed the application, a reference in the `manifest.yml` file can take care of the binding for you.

>NOTE: The commands shown in the preceding example may not exactly match the service or plan names available in your environment. You may have to adjust the `create-service` command to fit your environment. Use `cf marketplace` to see what is available.

Once the service is bound to your application, the connector's settings are available in `VCAP_SERVICES`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

### 3.2.4 Add SqlConnection

To use a `SqlConnection` in your application, add it to the service container in the `ConfigureServices()` method of the `Startup` class, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.SqlServer;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add SqlConnection configured from Configuration
        services.AddSqlServerConnection(Configuration);

        // Add framework services.
        services.AddMvc();
        ...
    }
    ...
```

The `AddSqlServerConnection(Configuration)` method call shown in the previous example configures the `SqlConnection` by using the configuration built by the application and adds the connection to the service container.

### 3.2.5 Use SqlConnection

Once you have configured and added the connection to the service container, you can inject it and use it in a controller or a view, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using System.Data.SqlClient;
...
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult SqlData([FromServices] SqlConnection dbConnection)
    {
        dbConnection.Open();

        MySqlCommand cmd = new MySqlCommand("SELECT * FROM TestData;", dbConnection);
        MySqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();

        while (rdr.Read())
        {
            ViewData["Key" + rdr[0]] = rdr[1];
        }

        rdr.Close();
        dbConnection.Close();

        return View();
    }
}
```

>NOTE: The preceding code does not create a database or a table or insert data. As written, it fails unless you create the database, table, and data ahead of time.

### 3.2.6 Add DbContext

#### 3.2.6.1 Entity Framework 6

To use the Microsoft SQL connector with Entity Framework 6, inject a DbContext into your application using the AddDbContext<>() method (provided by Steeltoe) that takes an IConfiguration as a parameter, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.SqlServer.EF6;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...
        services.AddDbContext<TestContext>(Configuration);
        ...
    }
    ...
```

The `AddDbContext<TestContext>(..)` method call configures `TestContext` by using the configuration built earlier and then adds the `DbContext` (`TestContext`) to the service container.

Your `DbContext` does not need to be modified from a standard EF6 `DbContext` to work with Steeltoe:

```csharp
using System.Data.Entity;
...

public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public TestContext(string connectionString) : base(connectionString)
    {
    }
    public DbSet<TestData> TestData { get; set; }
}
```

#### 3.2.6.2 Entity Framework Core

To use the Microsoft SQL Server connector with Entity Framework Core, inject a `DbContext` into your application with the standard `AddDbContext<>()` method, substituting Steeltoe’s `UseSqlServer` method that takes an `IConfiguration` as a parameter in the options configuration for the standard `UseSqlServer` method. This example demonstrates the basic usage:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.SqlServer.EFCore;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...
        services.AddDbContext<TestContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(Configuration));
        ...
    }
    ...
```

Your `DbContext` does not need to be modified from a standard `DbContext` to work with Steeltoe:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
...

public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public TestContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
    {

    }
    public DbSet<TestData> TestData { get; set; }
}

```

If you need to set additional properties for the `DbContext` like `MigrationsAssembly` or connection retry settings, create an `Action<SqlServerDbContextOptionsBuilder>` like this:

```csharp
Action<SqlServerDbContextOptionsBuilder> sqlServerOptionsAction = (o) =>
{
  o.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(Startup).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetName().Name);
  // Configuring Connection Resiliency: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency
  o.EnableRetryOnFailure(maxRetryCount: 15, maxRetryDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30), errorNumbersToAdd: null);
};
```

Pass your new options action into the AddDbContext method:

```csharp
services.AddDbContext<TestContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(Configuration, sqlServerOptionsAction));
```

### 3.2.7 Use DbContext

Once you have configured and added the DbContext to the service container, you can inject it and use it in a controller or a view, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Project.Models;
...
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult SqlData([FromServices] TestContext context)
    {
        return View(context.TestData.ToList());
    }
```

# 4.0 RabbitMQ

This connector simplifies using the [RabbitMQ Client](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-dotnet.html) in an application running on Cloud Foundry. We recommend following that tutorial, because you need to know how to use it before proceeding to use the connector.

This connector provides a `IHealthContributor` which you can use in conjunction with the [Steeltoe Management Health](https://steeltoe.io/docs/steeltoe-management/#1-2-3-health) check endpoint.  See the [Using Health Contributors](#using-health-contributors) section for details on how to make use of it.

The source code for this connector can be found [here](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors).

## 4.1 Quick Start

This quick start uses an ASP.NET Core sample application and the Steeltoe RabbitMQ Connector to connect to a RabbitMQ service on Cloud Foundry.

Specifically, it shows how to use a `RabbitMQ.Client` to send and receive messages on the bound RabbitMQ service.

In addition to this quick start, there is an ASP.NET4 sample that was built with Autofac in [Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/RabbitMQ4](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/RabbitMQ4).

### 4.1.1 Locate Sample

To get started, change directory to where the samples are stored, as follows:

```bash
cd Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/RabbitMQ
```

### 4.1.2 Create Service

You can use the Cloud Foundry CLI to create a service instance of RabbitMQ on Cloud Foundry.

The following commands assume that you use the RabbitMQ service provided by Pivotal on Cloud Foundry:

```bash
# Create a RabbitMQ service instance on Cloud Foundry
cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard myRabbitMQService

# Make sure the service is ready
cf services
```

If you use a different service, adjust the `create-service` command to fit your environment.

### 4.1.3 Publish and Push Sample

See [Publish Sample](#publish-sample) and the sections that follow for instructions on how to publish and push this sample to either Linux or Windows.

### 4.1.4 Observe Logs

You can use the `cf logs` command to see log output.

### 4.1.5 View Data

At this point, the app is running.

To send a message, click "Send" and use the form to send a message over RabbitMQ.

Having sent a message, click "Receive" to see those messages.

### 4.1.6 Understand the Sample

The sample was created with the .NET Core tooling `mvc` template (`dotnet new mvc`) and then modified to use the Steeltoe framework.

To gain an understanding of the Steeltoe related changes to the generated template code, examine the following files:

* `RabbitMQ.csproj`: Contains the `PackageReference` for the `RabbitMQ.Client` and the Steeltoe NuGet `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorCore`.
* `Program.cs`: Added `.UseCloudFoundryHosting()` for dynamic port binding and `.AddCloudFoundry()` to read `VCAP_SERVICES` when pushed to Cloud Foundry
* `Startup.cs`: Code added to the `ConfigureServices()` method to add a RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` to the service container
* `RabbitMQController.cs`: Code added for injection of a RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` into the Controller. The `ConnectionFactory` is used in the `Send` and `Receive` action methods.
* `Receive.cshtml`: The view used to display the received message data values.
* `Send.cshtml`: The view used to submit message data.

## 4.2 Usage

You should know how the new .NET [Configuration service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration) works before starting to use the connector. To configure the connector, you need a basic understanding of the `ConfigurationBuilder` and how to add providers to the builder.

You should also know how the ASP.NET Core [Startup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/startup) class is used in configuring the application services for the application. Pay particular attention to the usage of the `ConfigureServices()` method.

You probably want some understanding of how to use the [RabbitMQ Client](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-dotnet.html) before starting to use this connector.

To use this Connector:

1. Create and bind a RabbitMQ service instance to your application.
1. Optionally, configure any RabbitMQ client settings (such as in `appsettings.json`)
1. Add the Steeltoe Cloud Foundry config provider to your `ConfigurationBuilder`.
1. Add the RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` to your `ServiceCollection`.

### 4.2.1 Add NuGet Reference

To use the RabbitMQ connector, you need to add a reference to the appropriate [Steeltoe Connector NuGet package](#add-nuget-references) and `RabbitMQ.Client`.

### 4.2.2 Configure Settings

The connector supports several settings for the RabbitMQ ConnectionFactory that can be useful when you are developing and testing an application locally and you need to have the connector configure the connection for non-default settings.

The following example of the connectors configuration in JSON shows how to setup a connection to a RabbitMQ server at `amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1/`:

```json
{
  ...
  "rabbitmq": {
    "client": {
      "uri": "amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1/"
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

The following table describes all the possible settings for the connector:

|Key|Description|Default|
|---|---|---|
|server|Hostname or IP Address of the server|127.0.0.1|
|port|Port number of the server|5672|
|username|Username for authentication|not set|
|password|Password for authentication|not set|
|virtualHost|Virtual host to which to connect|not set|
|sslEnabled|Should SSL be enabled|false|
|sslPort|SSL Port number of server|5671|
|uri|Full connection string|built from settings|
|urlEncodedCredentials|Set to `true` if your service broker provides URL-encoded credentials|false|

>IMPORTANT: All of these settings should be prefixed with `rabbitmq:client:`.

The samples and most templates are already set up to read from `appsettings.json`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

### 4.2.3 Cloud Foundry

To use RabbitMQ on Cloud Foundry, you can create and bind an instance to your application using the Cloud Foundry CLI, as follows:

```bash
# Create RabbitMQ service
cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard myRabbitMQService

# Bind the service to `myApp`
cf bind-service myApp myRabbitMQService

# Restage the app to pick up changes
cf restage myApp
```

>NOTE: The preceding commands assume you use the RabbitMQ service provided by Pivotal on Cloud Foundry. If you use a different service, adjust the `create-service` command to fit your environment.

Once the service is bound to your application, the connector's settings are available in `VCAP_SERVICES`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

### 4.2.4 Add RabbitMQ ConnectionFactory

To use a RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` in your application, add it to the service container in the `ConfigureServices()` method of the `Startup` class, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.RabbitMQ;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add RabbitMQ ConnectionFactory configured from Cloud Foundry
        services.AddRabbitMQConnection(Configuration);

        // Add framework services.
        services.AddMvc();
        ...
    }
    ...
```

### 4.2.5 Use RabbitMQ ConnectionFactory

Once you have configured and added the RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` to the service container, you can inject it and use it in a controller or a view, as shown in the following example:

 ```csharp
using RabbitMQ.Client;
 ...
 public class HomeController : Controller
 {
     ...
     public IActionResult RabbitMQData([FromServices] ConnectionFactory factory)
     {

         using (var connection = factory.CreateConnection())
         using (var channel = connection.CreateModel())
         {
             CreateQueue(channel);
             var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("a message");
             channel.BasicPublish(exchange: "",
                                  routingKey: "a-topic",
                                  basicProperties: null,
                                  body: body);

         }
         return View();
     }

 }

 ```

# 5.0 Redis

 This connector simplifies using a Microsoft [RedisCache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed#using-a-redis-distributed-cache) or a StackExchange [IConnectionMultiplexer](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/) in an application running on Cloud Foundry.

In addition to the [Quick Start](#5-1-quick-start), other Steeltoe sample applications are available to help you understand how to use this connector:

* [AspDotNet4/Redis4](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/Redis4): Same as the next Quick Start but built for ASP.NET 4.x.
* [DataProtection](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/Security/src/RedisDataProtectionKeyStore): A sample application showing how to use the Steeltoe DataProtection Key Storage Provider for Redis.
* [MusicStore](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/master/MusicStore): A sample application showing how to use all of the Steeltoe components together in an ASP.NET Core application. This is a micro-services based application built from the ASP.NET Core reference app MusicStore provided by Microsoft.

This connector provides a `IHealthContributor` which you can use in conjunction with the [Steeltoe Management Health](https://steeltoe.io/docs/steeltoe-management/#1-2-3-health) check endpoint.  See the [Using Health Contributors](#using-health-contributors) section for details on how to make use of it.

The source code for this connector can be found [here](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors).

## 5.1 Quick Start

```

If you use a different service, you have to adjust the `create-service` command to fit your environment.

### 5.1.3 Publish and Push Sample

See [Publish Sample](#publish-sample) and the sections that follow for instructions on how to publish and push this sample to either Linux or Windows.

### 5.1.4 Observe Logs

You can use the `cf logs` command to see log output.

### 5.1.5 What to expect

At this point, the app is running. On startup, the app inserts two key/value pairs into the bound Redis Cache.

To display those values, click on the "Cache Data" link in the menu and you should see the key/value pairs from the Microsoft `RedisCache`.

Click on the "ConnectionMultiplexer Data" link to view data from the StackExchange `ICollectionMultiplexer`.

### 5.1.6 Understand Sample

The sample was created from the .NET Core tooling `mvc` template (`dotnet new mvc`) and modified to use the Steeltoe frameworks.

To understand the Steeltoe related changes to the generated template code, examine the following files:

* `Redis.csproj`: Contains the `PackageReference` for the Steeltoe NuGet `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorCore`.
* `Program.cs`: Added `.UseCloudFoundryHosting()` for dynamic port binding and `.AddCloudFoundry()` to read `VCAP_SERVICES` when pushed to Cloud Foundry.
* `Startup.cs`: Code added to the `ConfigureServices()` method to add an `IDistributedCache` and an `IConnectionMultiplexer` to the service container.
* `HomeController.cs`: Code added for injection of a `IDistributedCache` or `IConnectionMultiplexer` into the Controller. These are used to obtain data from the cache and then to display it.
* `CacheData.cshtml`: The view used to display the Redis data values obtained using `IDistributedCache`.
* `ConnData.cshtml`: The view used to display the Redis data values obtained using `IConnectionMultiplexer`.
* `Models folder`: Contains code to initialize the Redis cache.

## 5.2 Usage

You should know how the .NET [Configuration service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration) works before starting to use the connector. To configure the connector, you need a basic understanding of the `ConfigurationBuilder` and how to add providers to the builder.

You should also know how the ASP.NET Core [Startup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/startup) class is used in configuring the application services for the app. Pay particular attention to the usage of the `ConfigureServices()` method.

You probably want some understanding of how to use the [RedisCache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed#using-a-redis-distributed-cache) or [IConnectionMultiplexer](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/) before starting to use this connector.

To use this connector:

1. Create a Redis Service instance and bind it to your application.
1. Optionally, configure any Redis client settings (for example, in `appsettings.json`).
1. Add the Steeltoe Cloud Foundry config provider to your ConfigurationBuilder.
1. Add DistributedRedisCache or ConnectionMultiplexer to your ServiceCollection.

### 5.2.1 Add NuGet Reference

To use the Redis connector, you need to add a reference to the appropriate [Steeltoe Connector NuGet package](#add-nuget-references) and a reference to `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Redis`, `StackExchange.Redis`, or `StackExchange.Redis.StrongName`.

>NOTE: The requirement to add a direct Redis package reference is new as of version 2.0.0.

>NOTE: Because `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Redis` depends on `StackExchange.Redis.StrongName`, adding a reference to the Microsoft library also enables access to the StackExchange classes, as seen in the sample application.

### 5.2.2 Configure Settings

The connector supports several settings for the Redis connection that can be useful when you are developing and testing an application locally and you need to have the connector configure the connection for non-default settings.

The following example of the connector's configuration in JSON that shows how to set up a connection to a Redis server at `https://foo.bar:1111`:

```json
{
  ...
  "redis": {
    "client": {
      "host": "https://foo.bar",
      "port": 1111
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

The following table table describes all possible settings for the connector

|Key|Description|Default|
|---|---|---|
|host|Hostname or IP Address of the server|localhost|
|port|Port number of the server|6379|
|endPoints|Comma-separated list of host:port pairs|not set|
|clientName|Identification for the connection within redis|not set|
|connectRetry|Times to repeat initial connect attempts|3|
|connectTimeout|Timeout (ms) for connect operations|5000|
|abortOnConnectFail|Will not create a connection while no servers are available|true|
|keepAlive|Time (seconds) at which to send a message to help keep sockets alive|-1|
|resolveDns|Whether DNS resolution should be explicit and eager, rather than implicit|false|
|ssl|Whether SSL encryption should be used|false|
|sslHost|Enforces a particular SSL host identity on the server's certificate|not set|
|writeBuffer|Size of the output buffer|4096|
|connectionString|Full connection string|built from settings|
|instanceId|Cache ID. Used only with `IDistributedCache`|not set|
|urlEncodedCredentials|Set to `true` if your service broker provides URL-encoded credentials|false|

>IMPORTANT: All of these settings should be prefixed with `redis:client:`.

The samples and most templates are already set up to read from `appsettings.json`See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

>NOTE: If a ConnectionString is provided and VCAP_SERVICES are not detected (a typical scenario for local app development), the ConnectionString will be used exactly as provided.

### 5.2.3 Cloud Foundry

To use Redis on Cloud Foundry, create and bind an instance to your application by using the Cloud Foundry CLI, as shown in the following example:

```bash
# Create Redis service
cf create-service p-redis shared-vm myRedisCache

# Bind service to `myApp`
cf bind-service myApp myRedisCache

# Restage the app to pick up change
cf restage myApp
```

>NOTE: The preceding commands assume you use the Redis service provided by Pivotal on Cloud Foundry. If you use a different service, you have to adjust the `create-service` command to fit your environment.

Version 2.1.1+ of this connector works with the [Azure Open Service Broker for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/azure-open-service-broker-pcf/index.html). Be sure to set `redis:client:urlEncodedCredentials` to `true` as this broker may provide credentials that have been URL Encoded.

Once the service is bound to your application, the connector's settings are available in `VCAP_SERVICES`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

### 5.2.4 Add IDistributedCache

To use Microsoft's `IDistributedCache` in your application, add it to the service container, as shown in the following example:

 ```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.Redis;
public class Startup {
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup()
    {
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Add Microsoft Redis Cache (IDistributedCache) configured from Cloud Foundry
        services.AddDistributedRedisCache(Configuration);

        // Add framework services
        services.AddMvc();
    }
```

The `AddDistributedRedisCache(Configuration)` method call configures the `IDistributedCache` by using the configuration built by the application earlier and adds the connection to the service container.

### 5.2.5 Use IDistributedCache

The following example shows how to inject and use the `IDistributedCache` in a controller once it has been added to the service container:

 ```csharp
 using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Distributed;
 ...
 public class HomeController : Controller
 {
     private IDistributedCache _cache;
     public HomeController(IDistributedCache cache)
     {
         _cache = cache;
     }
     ...
     public IActionResult CacheData()
     {
         string key1 = Encoding.Default.GetString(_cache.Get("Key1"));
         string key2 = Encoding.Default.GetString(_cache.Get("Key2"));

         ViewData["Key1"] = key1;
         ViewData["Key2"] = key2;

         return View();
     }
 }
 ```

### 5.2.6 Add IConnectionMultiplexer

To use a StackExchange `IConnectionMultiplexer` in your application directly, add it to the service container in the `ConfigureServices()` method of the `Startup` class, as shown in the following example:

 ```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.Redis;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {

        // Add StackExchange IConnectionMultiplexer configured from Cloud Foundry
        services.AddRedisConnectionMultiplexer(Configuration);

        // Add framework services
        services.AddMvc();
        ...
    }
    ...
```

The `AddRedisConnectionMultiplexer(Configuration)` method call configures the `IConnectionMultiplexer` by using the configuration built by the application and adds the connection to the service container.

>NOTE: If necessary, you can use both `IDistributedCache` and `IConnectionMultiplexer` in your application.

### 5.2.7 Use IConnectionMultiplexer

Once you have configured and added the `IConnectionMultiplexer` to the service container, you can inject it and use it in a controller or a view, as shown in the following example:

 ```csharp
 using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Distributed;
 ...
 public class HomeController : Controller
 {
     private IConnectionMultiplexer _conn;
     public HomeController(IConnectionMultiplexer conn)
     {
         _conn = conn;
     }
     ...
      public IActionResult ConnData()
    {
        IDatabase db = _conn.GetDatabase();

        string key1 = db.StringGet("ConnectionMultiplexerKey1");
        string key2 = db.StringGet("ConnectionMultiplexerKey2");

        ViewData["ConnectionMultiplexerKey1"] = key1;
        ViewData["ConnectionMultiplexerKey2"] = key2;

        return View();
    }
 }
 ```

# 6.0 OAuth

This connector simplifies using Cloud Foundry OAuth2 security services (for example, [UAA Server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) or [Pivotal Single Sign-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/)) by exposing the Cloud Foundry OAuth service configuration data as injectable `IOption<OAuthServiceOptions>`. It is used by the [Cloud Foundry External Security Providers](../steeltoe-security) but can be used separately.

## 6.1 Quick Start

This quick start consists of an ASP.NET Core sample application showing how to use the OAuth Connector to expose the binding information provided by the Cloud Foundry UAA Server.

In addition to this quick start, there is an ASP.NET4 sample that was built with Autofac in [Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/OAuth4](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples/tree/dev/Connectors/src/AspDotNet4/OAuth4).

### 6.1.1 Locate Sample

To get started, change directory to where the samples are stored, as follows:

```bash
cd Samples/Connectors/src/AspDotNetCore/OAuth
```

### 6.1.2 Create Service

You must first create an instance of an OAuth2 service in an org and a space. In this quick start, we will the UAA Server. (The other choice is Pivotal Single Sign-on.)

To set up UAA, we need to create a user-provided service that provides the appropriate UAA server configuration data to the application.

```bash
# Create a OAuth service instance on Cloud Foundry
cf cups myOAuthService -p oauth.json

# Make sure the service is ready
cf services
```

>NOTE: The contents of `oauth.json` must be modified to match your Cloud Foundry configuration.

### 6.1.3 Publish and Push Sample

See [Publish Sample](#publish-sample) and the sections that follow for instructions on how to publish and push this sample to either Linux or Windows.

### 6.1.4 Observe Logs

You can use the `cf logs` command to see log output.

### 6.1.5 View Data

At this point, the app is running.

On the "Apps" menu, click on the "OAuth Options" menu item to see meaningful configuration data for the bound OAuth service.

### 6.1.6 Understand Sample

The sample was created using the .NET Core tooling `mvc` template (`dotnet new mvc`)  and then modified to use the Steeltoe frameworks.

To gain an understanding of the Steeltoe related changes to the generated template code, examine the following files:

* `OAuth.csproj`: Contains the `PackageReference` for the Steeltoe NuGet `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorCore`
* `Program.cs`: Added `.UseCloudFoundryHosting()` for dynamic port binding and `.AddCloudFoundry()` to read `VCAP_SERVICES` when pushed to Cloud Foundry.
* `Startup.cs`: Code added to the `ConfigureServices()` method to add a `OAuthServiceOptions` to the service container.
* `HomeController.cs`: Code added for injection of a `OAuthServiceOptions` into the Controller. The `OAuthServiceOptions` contains the binding information from Cloud Foundry.
* `OAuthOptions.cshtml`: The view used to display the OAuth data.

## 6.2 Usage

You should know how the new .NET [Configuration service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration) works before starting to use the connector. To configure the connector, you need a basic understanding of the `ConfigurationBuilder` and how to add providers to the builder.

You should also know how the ASP.NET Core [Startup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/startup) class is used in configuring the application services for the application. Pay particular attention to the usage of the `ConfigureServices()` method.

You probably want some understanding of Cloud Foundry OAuth2 security services (such as [UAA Server](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) or [Pivotal Single Sign-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/)) before starting to use this connector.

To use this Connector:

1. Create an OAuth service instance and bind it to your application.
1. (Optional) Configure any additional settings the OAuth connector needs.
1. Add the Steeltoe Cloud Foundry configuration provider to your ConfigurationBuilder.
1. Add the OAuth connector to your ServiceCollection.
1. Access the OAuth service options.

### 6.2.1 Add NuGet Reference

To use the OAuth connector, you need to add a reference to the appropriate [Steeltoe Connector NuGet package](#add-nuget-references).

### 6.2.2 Configure Settings

Configuring additional settings for the connector is not typically required, but, when Cloud Foundry uses self-signed certificates, you might need to disable certificate validation, as shown in the following example:

```json
{
  ...
  "security": {
    "oauth2": {
      "client": {
        "validateCertificates": false
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

>CAUTION: Self-signed certificates are inherently insecure. Never use them for a production environment.

The samples and most templates are already set up to read from `appsettings.json`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

### 6.2.3 Cloud Foundry

There are multiple ways to set up OAuth services on Cloud Foundry.

In the [quick start](#6-1-quick-start), we used a user-provided service to define a direct binding to the Cloud Foundry UAA server. Alternatively, you can use the [Pivotal Single Sign-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/)) product to provision an OAuth service binding. The process to create service binding varies for each of the approaches.

Regardless of which you choose, once the service is bound to your application, the connector's settings are available in `VCAP_SERVICES`. See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

### 6.2.4 Add OAuthServiceOptions

Once the OAuth service has been bound to the application, add the OAuth connector to your service collection in the `ConfigureServices()` method of the `Startup` class, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.OAuth;

public class Startup {
    ...
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }
    public Startup(...)
    {
      ...
    }
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Configure and Add IOptions<OAuthServiceOptions> to the container
        services.AddOAuthServiceOptions(Configuration);

        // Add framework services.
        services.AddMvc();
        ...
    }
    ...
```

The `AddOAuthServiceOptions(Configuration)` method call configures a `OAuthServiceOptions` instance by using the configuration built by the application and adds it to the service container.

### 6.2.5 Use OAuthServiceOptions

Finally, you can inject and use the configured `OAuthServiceOptions` into a controller, as shown in the following example:

 ```csharp
 using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.OAuth;
 ...
 public class HomeController : Controller
 {
     OAuthServiceOptions _options;

     public HomeController(IOptions<OAuthServiceOptions> oauthOptions)
     {
         _options = oauthOptions.Value;
     }
     ...
     public IActionResult OAuthOptions()
     {
         ViewData["ClientId"] = _options.ClientId;
         ViewData["ClientSecret"] = _options.ClientSecret;
         ViewData["UserAuthorizationUrl"] = _options.UserAuthorizationUrl;
         ViewData["AccessTokenUrl"] = _options.AccessTokenUrl;
         ViewData["UserInfoUrl"] = _options.UserInfoUrl;
         ViewData["TokenInfoUrl"] = _options.TokenInfoUrl;
         ViewData["JwtKeyUrl"] = _options.JwtKeyUrl;
         ViewData["ValidateCertificates"] = _options.ValidateCertificates;
         ViewData["Scopes"] = CommaDelimit(_options.Scope);

         return View();
     }
 }
 ```

# 7.0 MongoDB

This connector simplifies using MongoDB in an application running on Cloud Foundry with the [.NET MongoDB Driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/csharp/).

>NOTE: There are currently no dedicated samples for the MongoDB connector. You can see it in action in the Steeltoe fork of [eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/eShopOnContainers), in the Locations API and the Marketing API.

## 7.1 Usage

To use this connector:

1. Create a MongoDB service instance and bind it to your application.
1. Optionally, configure any MongoDB client settings.
1. Add the Steeltoe Cloud Foundry config provider to you `ConfigurationBuilder`.
1. Add MongoDB classes to your DI container.

### 7.1.1 Add NuGet Reference

To use the MongoDB connector, add the official [MongoDB.Driver NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MongoDB.Driver/) as you would if you weren't using Steeltoe. Then, add a reference to the appropriate [Steeltoe Connector NuGet package](#add-nuget-references)

### 7.1.2 Configure Settings

The MongoDB connector supports several settings for creating

```json
{
  "mongodb": {
    "client": {
      "server": "localhost",
      "port": 27017,
      "options": {
        "replicaSet": "rs0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following table table describes all possible settings for the connector

|Key|Description|Default|
|---|---|---|
|server|Hostname or IP Address of the server|localhost|
|port|Port number of the server|27017|
|username|Username for authentication|not set|
|password|Password for authentication|not set|
|database|Name of the database to use|not set|
|options|any additional [options](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.7/apidocs/html/T_MongoDB_Driver_MongoClientSettings.htm), passed through as provided|not set|
|connectionString|Full connection string|built from settings|
|urlEncodedCredentials|Set to `true` if your service broker provides URL-encoded credentials|false|

>IMPORTANT: All of these settings should be prefixed with `mongodb:client:`.

The samples and most templates are already set up to read from `appsettings.json`See [Reading Configuration Values](#reading-configuration-values).

>NOTE: If a ConnectionString is provided and VCAP_SERVICES are not detected (a typical scenario for local app development), the ConnectionString will be used exactly as provided.

### 7.1.3 Cloud Foundry

To use MongoDB on Cloud Foundry, create and bind an instance to your application by using the Cloud Foundry CLI, as shown in the following example:

```bash
# Create MongoDB service
cf create-service mongodb-odb standalone_small myMongoDb

# Bind service to `myApp`
cf bind-service myApp myMongoDb

# Restage the app to pick up change
cf restage myApp
```

>NOTE: The preceding commands assume you use the MongoDB Enterprise Service for PCF. If you use a different service, you may have to adjust the `create-service` command to fit your environment.

### 7.1.4 Add Mongo Client

To use `MongoClient` and `MongoUrl` in your application, use the extension provided for Microsoft DI:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.MongoDb;
public class Startup
{
  ...
  public IServiceProvider ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMongoClient(Configuration);
  }
  ...
}
```

Or the extension provided for Autofac:

```csharp
using Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorAutofac;
...
  ContainerBuilder container = new ContainerBuilder();
  var regBuilder = container.RegisterMongoDbConnection(configuration);
...
```

### 7.1.4 Use Mongo Client

The following example shows how to inject and use an `IMongoClient` and `MongoUrl` in order to get an `IMongoDatabase` to interact with:

```csharp
public class SomeClass
{
  private readonly IMongoDatabase _database = null;
  public SomeClass(IMongoClient mongoClient, MongoUrl mongoUrl)
  {
    _database = mongoClient.GetDatabase(mongoUrl.DatabaseName);
  }
  public IMongoCollection<SomeObject> MyObjects
  {
      get { return _database.GetCollection<SomeObject>("MyObjects"); }
  }
}
```

# Common Steps

## Publish Sample

### ASP.NET Core

Use the `dotnet` CLI to [build and locally publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) the application for the framework and runtime you will deploy the application to:

* Linux with .NET Core: `dotnet publish -f netcoreapp2.1 -r ubuntu.14.04-x64`
* Windows with .NET Core: `dotnet publish -f netcoreapp2.1 -r win10-x64`
* Windows with .NET Platform: `dotnet publish -f net461 -r win10-x64`

>NOTE: Starting with .NET Core 2.0, the `dotnet publish` command will automatically restore dependencies for you. Running `dotnet restore` explicitly is not generally required.

### ASP.NET 4.x

1. Open the solution for the sample in Visual Studio
1. Right click on the project, select "Publish"
1. Use the included `FolderProfile` to publish to `bin/Debug/net461/win10-x64/publish`

## Push Sample

Use the Cloud Foundry CLI to push the published application to Cloud Foundry using the parameters that match what you selected for framework and runtime:

```bash
# Push to Linux cell
cf push -f manifest.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/ubuntu.14.04-x64/publish

# Push to Windows cell, .NET Core
cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/win10-x64/publish

# Push to Windows cell, .NET Framework
cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/net461/win10-x64/publish
```

>NOTE: all sample manifests have been defined to bind their application to their service(s) as created above.

## Observe Logs

To see the logs as you startup the application, use `cf logs oauth`.

On a Linux cell, you should see something resembling the following during startup:

```bash
2016-06-01T09:14:14.38-0600 [CELL/0]     OUT Creating container
2016-06-01T09:14:15.93-0600 [CELL/0]     OUT Successfully created container
2016-06-01T09:14:17.14-0600 [CELL/0]     OUT Starting health monitoring of container
2016-06-01T09:14:21.04-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Hosting environment: Development
2016-06-01T09:14:21.04-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Content root path: /home/vcap/app
2016-06-01T09:14:21.04-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Now listening on: http://*:8080
2016-06-01T09:14:21.04-0600 [APP/0]      OUT Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
2016-06-01T09:14:21.41-0600 [CELL/0]     OUT Container became healthy
```

On Windows cells, you should see something slightly different but with the same information.

## Reading Configuration Values

Once the connector's settings have been defined, the next step is to read them so that they can be made available to the connector.

The code in the next example reads connector settings from the `appsettings.json` file with the .NET JSON configuration provider (`AddJsonFile("appsettings.json"))` and from `VCAP_SERVICES` with `AddCloudFoundry()`. Both sources are then added to the configuration builder. The following code shows how to read from both sources:

```csharp
public class Program {
    ...
    public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args)
    {
        return new WebHostBuilder()
            ...
            .UseCloudFoundryHosting()
            ...
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration((builderContext, configBuilder) =>
            {
                var env = builderContext.HostingEnvironment;
                configBuilder.SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
                    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
                    .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json", optional: true)
                    .AddEnvironmentVariables()
                    // Add to configuration the Cloudfoundry VCAP settings
                    .AddCloudFoundry();
            })
            .Build();
    }
    ...
```

When pushing the application to Cloud Foundry, the settings from service bindings merge with the settings from other configuration mechanisms (such as `appsettings.json`).

If there are merge conflicts, the last provider added to the Configuration takes precedence and overrides all others.

To manage application settings centrally instead of with individual files, use [Steeltoe Configuration](/docs/steeltoe-configuration) and a tool such as [Spring Cloud Config Server](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config)

>NOTE: If you use the Spring Cloud Config Server, `AddConfigServer()` automatically calls `AddCloudFoundry()` for you.

## Add NuGet References

To use Steeltoe Connectors, you need to add a reference to the appropriate NuGet package based on the type of the application you are building and what dependency injector you have chosen, if any. The following table describes the available packages:

|App Type|Package|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Console/ASP.NET 4.x|`Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorBase`|Base functionality. No dependency injection|
|ASP.NET 4.x with Autofac|`Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorAutofac`|Includes base. Adds Autofac dependency injection|
|ASP.NET Core|`Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorCore`|Includes base. Adds Microsoft Dependency Injection|
|ASP.NET Core|`Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.EF6Core`|Includes base. Adds Entity Framework 6 with Microsoft Dependency Injection|
|ASP.NET Core|`Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.EFCore`|Includes base. Adds Entity Framework Core with Microsoft Dependency Injection|

To add any NuGet package, use the package manager tools or (with .NET Core applications only) directly add the appropriate package to your project by using the a `PackageReference`, as shown in the following listing:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
...
    <PackageReference Include="Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorBase" Version= "2.1.0"/>
...
</ItemGroup>
```

## Using Health Contributors

At present, Steeltoe provides the following `IHealthContributor` implementations you can choose from:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|[RabbitMQHealthContributor](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors/blob/master/src/Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorBase/Queue/RabbitMQHealthContributor.cs)|checks RabbitMQ connection health|
|[RedisHealthContributor](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors/blob/master/src/Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorBase/Cache/RedisHealthContributor.cs)|checks Redis cache connection health|
|[RelationalHealthContributor](https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Connectors/blob/master/src/Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorBase/Relational/RelationalHealthContributor.cs)|checks relational database connection health (MySql, Postgres, SqlServer)|

Each of these contributors are located in the `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorBase` package and are made available to your application when you reference the connector package.

If you want to use any one of the `IHealthContributor`s above in an ASP.NET Core application, simply make use of the corresponding connector as you would normally. By doing so, the contributor is automatically added to the service container for you and is automatically discovered and used by the Health endpoint.

If you want to make use of any of the contributors in an ASP.NET 4.x application, where no service container exists, you must construct an instance of it using a factory method contained in the contributor and then provide it to the Health endpoint.

For example, to create an instance of a MySql health contributor you can use the `GetMySqlContributor()` method in the `RelationalHealthContributor` as shown below and supply it to the endpoint actuator.

```csharp
public class ManagementConfig
{
    public static void ConfigureManagementActuators(IConfiguration configuration, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory = null)
    {
        ...
        ActuatorConfigurator.UseHealthActuator(
            configuration,
            new DefaultHealthAggregator(),
            GetHealthContributors(configuration),
            loggerFactory);
        ...

    }

    private static IEnumerable<IHealthContributor> GetHealthContributors(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        var healthContributors = new List<IHealthContributor>
        {
            new DiskSpaceContributor(),
            RelationalHealthContributor.GetMySqlContributor(configuration)
        };

        return healthContributors;
    }
```

## Using Microsoft Community HealthChecks for ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core also offers [Middleware and libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-2.
) and abstractions for reporting health. There is wide community support for these abstractions from libraries such as [AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks](https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks). It is now possible to use these community provided health checks and make them available via the [Steeltoe management health endpoint](/docs/steeltoe-management/#1-2-5-health)(for integration with PCF or any other infrastructure that depends on this format). In addition Steeltoe connectors now exposes functionality to easily get connection information which is needed to setup these Microsoft Health Checks. 

For example, to use the Steeltoe MySql connector but use Microsoft Health Checks make these changes to Startup.cs:

```csharp
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      // Get connection information from Steeltoe helper
      var cm = new ConnectionStringManager(Configuration);
      var connectionString = cm.Get<MySqlConnectionInfo>().ConnectionString;

      // Add microsoft community health checks from xabaril
      services.AddHealthChecks().AddMySql(connectionString);  

      // Add in a MySql connection (this method also adds an IHealthContributor for it)
      services.AddMySqlConnection(Configuration); // will now use microsoft health check instead of Steeltoe health check 

      // Add  Steeltoe Management endpoint services
      services.AddCloudFoundryActuators(Configuration);

      services.AddHealthChecksUI(); // Optionally use the health checks UI 

      // Add framework services.
      services.AddMvc();
  } 
  ```
  >NOTE: AddMySqlConnection will default to the Microsoft health check if found in the service container. This behavior can be toggled off by passing AddMySqlConnection(Configuration, addSteeltoeHealthChecks: true) which will add both health checks. Be warned that this will make the Health check endpoint slower by calling multiple health checks for the same service. 
  
  ```csharp
  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
  {
      ...

      // Optionally use Microsoft health middleware for Microsoft Health Checks at /Health
      app.UseHealthChecks("/Health", new HealthCheckOptions()
      {
          Predicate = _ => true,
          ResponseWriter = UIResponseWriter.WriteHealthCheckUIResponse
      });

      // Optionally use health checks ui at /healthchecks-ui
      app.UseHealthChecksUI();

      // Add management endpoints into pipeline
      // Steeltoe health check shows up at /cloudfoundryapplication/health
      app.UseCloudFoundryActuators();

...
```
