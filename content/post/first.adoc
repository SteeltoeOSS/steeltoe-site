http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html[Microservices] represent the latest evolution in modern service-oriented architectures, bringing with them the promise of continuous delivery of independent business capabilities. Microservices are "`simple, and do one thing well`" (Sam Newman), and invert the traditional ESB-centric SOA by employing "`smart endpoints with dumb pipes`" (Martin Fowler).
